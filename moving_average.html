            <h2>Context: When is a Moving Average Filter Used?</h2>
            <p>The goal of this project is to implement a noise-reduction digital signal processing algorithm optimized
                for embedded systems, with a focus on performance, efficiency, and practical implementation in C. The
                project also analyzes the trade-offs and benefits of the chosen algorithm in terms of computational
                complexity, accuracy, and real-world usability.</p>
            <p>The algorithm selected for this project is the moving average filter, a fundamental tool in digital
                signal processing. Its performance will be compared against more sophisticated filters, such as the
                Gaussian filter and the Blackman filter, to highlight its strengths and limitations in different
                contexts.</p>

        <!-- Mathematical Representation -->
        <section id="math-representation">
            <h2>Mathematical Representation</h2>
            <p>The moving average filter works by averaging a specified number of points from the input signal to
                produce each point in the output signal. Mathematically, it is represented as:</p>
            <div class="equation-placeholder">
                <!-- Placeholder for the equation -->
                <p>Insert mathematical equation here.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Here, <code>M</code> represents the number of points included in the average, <code>x[i]</code> is the
                input signal, and <code>y[i]</code> is the resulting output signal. The moving average filter is
                equivalent to a convolution with a rectangular pulse, where the pulse has an area of one and a width
                corresponding to the number of samples averaged.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- C Code Section -->
        <section id="c-code">
            <h2>Implementation in C</h2>
            <p>The implementation in C demonstrates the filter's simplicity and efficiency. Below is the key portion of
                the code:</p>
            <pre><code>
#include <stdio.h>

void moving_average_filter(float *input, float *output, int num_samples, int window_size) {
    float accumulator = 0.0;

    // Initialize the accumulator with the first `window_size` points
    for (int i = 0; i < window_size; i++) {
        accumulator += input[i];
    }
    output[window_size / 2] = accumulator / window_size;

    // Sliding window implementation
    for (int i = window_size / 2 + 1; i < num_samples - window_size / 2; i++) {
        accumulator = accumulator - input[i - window_size / 2 - 1] + input[i + window_size / 2];
        output[i] = accumulator / window_size;
    }
}
            </code></pre>

        <!-- Filter Results -->

        </section>

        <!-- Tradeoffs Section -->
        <section id="tradeoffs">
            <h2>Trade-offs and Frequency Response</h2>
            <p>The frequency response of the moving average filter is calculated as the Fourier transform of the
                rectangular pulse. While the filter provides effective smoothing, its slow roll-off and poor attenuation
                of higher frequencies make it a less effective low-pass filter. Larger sample windows improve noise
                reduction but introduce slower settling times.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Efficient Implementation -->
        <section id="efficient-implementation">
            <h2>Efficient Implementation on Embedded Systems</h2>
            <p>The moving average filter is computationally efficient, requiring only addition and subtraction
                operations. Its recursive implementation updates the output using overlapping calculations,
                significantly reducing computational complexity:</p>
            <pre><code>
y[51] = y[50] + x[54] - x[47];
            </code></pre>
            <p>This optimization reduces the time complexity from <code>O(M * N)</code> to <code>O(N)</code>, making it
                ideal for real-time embedded systems with limited resources.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="comparisons">
            <h2>Comparisons with Other Filters</h2>
            <p>Further sections will compare the moving average filter to Gaussian and Blackman filters in terms of
                frequency response, noise reduction, and computational complexity.</p>
