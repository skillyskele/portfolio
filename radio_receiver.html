            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project involved designing and building a basic AM radio receiver to deepen my understanding of
                analog circuits. The receiver consists of an RLC tuning circuit, an RF amplifier, an AM demodulator, and
                an audio amplifier. The goal was to design a circuit capable of receiving and processing AM signals from
                a nearby station.</p>

        <!-- Stages Description -->
        <section id="stages">
            <h2>Stages of the Radio Receiver</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Antenna + RLC Circuit:</strong> Captures and tunes the signal to the desired frequency.</li>
                <li><strong>RF Amplifier:</strong> Boosts the weak signal for further processing.</li>
                <li><strong>AM Demodulator:</strong> Extracts the audio signal from the modulated carrier wave.</li>
                <li><strong>Audio Amplifier:</strong> Increases the audio signal strength to drive the speaker.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Circuit Design -->
        <section id="circuit-design">
            <h2>Circuit Design</h2>
            <p>Each stage was designed using standard analog components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tuning Circuit:</strong> A variable capacitor and inductor form an RLC circuit tuned to 1
                    MHz for AM reception.</li>
                <li><strong>RF Amplifier:</strong> A common-emitter amplifier for signal gain.</li>
                <li><strong>AM Demodulator:</strong> A diode and RC filter to rectify and demodulate the signal.</li>
                <li><strong>Audio Amplifier:</strong> A Class A amplifier for clear audio output.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="results">
            <h2>Results and Testing</h2>
            <p>The radio receiver successfully tuned into a local AM station. Challenges included fine-tuning the RLC
                circuit and minimizing interference from nearby frequencies.</p>

        <section id="takeaways">
            <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
            <p>This project reinforced my understanding of analog circuit design, including resonance in RLC circuits,
                amplifier design, and the principles of AM demodulation. It also highlighted the importance of component
                selection and debugging in achieving a functional system.</p>
